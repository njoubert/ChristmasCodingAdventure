# The Joubert Family's Christmas Coding Adventure!

The Joubert family all gets Raspberry Pi computers for Christmas, and embarks on a *Coding Adventure!*

### What??? What the...?? What IS all this stuff?? Where's the Candy??

1. I just gave all you guys **real computers!**. It can do everything your laptop can do!
2. You can actually build stuff with it! 
	- Simple stuff, like hook up speakers to it and use it as a music player... or
	- Build your own Hardware! You can connect buttons, lights, a small screen, etc!

Here's what's in the box:

|Img| What is it?                 | What's it for?? |
|---|-----------------------------|-----------------|
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/01_rpi.jpg)| 1x Raspberry Pi 2 (Model B) | A single-board 1Ghz quad-core computer with 1GB Ram! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/02_case_power.jpg)| Case and Power Supply       | Put the Pi in it, and power it up! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/03_sd.jpg)| 16GB MicroSD Card           | This is the "hard drive" for your Pi! We'll put Linux on this. |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/04_uart.jpg)| SILabs USB to UART Bridge   | We can use this to connect to the Pi from our normal computer, when we don't have a screen or a ethernet cable for the Pi. |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/05_cobbler.jpg)| T-Cobbler                   | A simple way to connect the Pi to a breadboard to hook up electronics! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/06_bboard.jpg)| Breadboard                  | Build electronic circuits simply by pushing components into this! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/07_cables.jpg)| Assorted Jumper Cables      | Hook things up together! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/08_buttons.jpg)| Buttons!                    | Program these to do something on click! |

|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/10_segment.jpg)| 7-segment display!          | Display numbers from your code! Temperature? Latency? Unread emails? Anything! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/11_res.jpg)| 1k and 10k Resistors!       | You need these to hook up LEDs and Buttons! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/12_trans.jpg)| 2N3904 Transistors!         | General purpose digital switch and amplifier! Use it to switch on and off larger stuff from the Pi. You can build a touch switch with it! |


### What the hell Niels, what kind of Christmas gift is this? Now what?

It was Pierre-Henri's idea! Anyway, the point is:


Here's some ideas!


### OK I guess that's cool... What might I build with this?
