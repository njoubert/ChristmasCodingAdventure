# The Joubert Family's Christmas Coding Adventure!

The Joubert family all gets Raspberry Pi computers for Christmas, and embarks on a *Coding Adventure!*

## What the hell Niels, what kind of Christmas gift is this? Now what?

It was Pierre-Henri's idea! Anyway, the point is:

1. This gift is a **real computer**. It can do everything your laptop can do!
2. You can actually build stuff with it! 
	- Simple stuff, like hook up speakers to it and use it as a music player... or
	- Build your own Hardware! Connect buttons, lights, a small screen, etc!


### OK I guess that's cool... What might I build with this?

Here's some ideas!

## What IS all this stuff??

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1x Raspberry Pi | A single-board 1Ghz quad-core computer! |
