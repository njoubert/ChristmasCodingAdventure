# The Joubert Family's Christmas Coding Adventure!

The Joubert family all gets Raspberry Pi computers for Christmas, and embarks on a *Coding Adventure!*


### What the hell Niels, what kind of Christmas gift is this? Now what?

1. I just gave all you guys **real computers!**. It can do everything your laptop can do!
2. You can actually build stuff with it! 
	- Simple stuff, like hook up speakers to it and use it as a music player... or
	- Build your own Hardware! You can connect buttons, lights, a small screen, etc!

It was Pierre-Henri's idea! Anyway, the point is:

### What is the Raspberry Pi?

It's basically the innards of an iPhone 5, with all the pins exposed! It's built and maintained by the [Raspberry Pi foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) as an educational tool.

- It has a powerful graphics card, can play 1080p video and has HDMI out!
- It can run either Linux or Android, and is built for easy programming! We'll mess around with Linux and Python!
- You can easily build your own hardware and attach it! Like buttons, LEDs, the christmas lights, etc...
- It's the most popular educational computer on the market!

Specifically, I gave you guys the newest Raspberry Pi 2! [Here's the Specs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)


### How do we get started?

**Check out LET'S GET CODING ON CHRISTMAS DAY!**

### OK I guess that's cool... What might I build with this?

There is a HUGE community of people doing awesome projects with the Raspberry Pi! 

Thing of these capabilities! You can access any data on the internet, and you have physical buttons and LEDs!

Here's some ideas:

*Multimedia-related:*

- Set it up as Airplay speakers! You can stream music to it from your phone!
- Use it as a media center! Hook it up to a screen and your external harddrive, and it can play movies!

*Software-related:*

- Use it to run a torrent client to save stuff to your external harddrive without needing your computer
- Make a digital picture frame! Have it cycle through instagram pictures.

*Hardware-related:*

Easier:

- Display temperature forecast for today on the 7-segment display
- Make the buttons send emails, texts, or scroll through different things on the display
- Measure latency to your favorite server, display it as an LED graph
- Make a sweet animation of LEDs blinking

Intensely awesome:

- Pair it with an Arduino Mega and RAMPS shield, and build any 3-axis movable CNC machine!
- Build a 3D Printer

### What's in the Box?

Each of you have slight variations on this, but here's the list of everything! 

|Img| What is it?                 | What's it for?? |

|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/07_cables.jpg)    | Assorted Jumper Cables      | Hook things up together! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/08_buttons.jpg)   | Buttons!                    | Program these to do something on click! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/09_led.jpg)       | R,G,B,W LEDs!               | Light them up from your code! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/10_segment.jpg)   | 7-segment display!          | Display numbers from your code! Temperature? Latency? Unread emails? Anything! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/11_res.jpg)       | 1k and 10k Resistors!       | You need these to hook up LEDs and Buttons! |
|![rpi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoubert/JoubertFamilyChristmasCodingAdventure/master/images/12_trans.jpg)     | 2N3904 Transistors!         | General purpose digital switch and amplifier! Use it to switch on and off larger stuff from the Pi. You can build a touch switch with it! |
