# The Joubert Family's Christmas Coding Adventure!

The Joubert family all gets Raspberry Pi computers for Christmas, and embarks on a *Coding Adventure!*

### What??? What the...?? What IS all this stuff?? Where's the Candy??

1. I just gave all you guys **real computers!**. It can do everything your laptop can do!
2. You can actually build stuff with it! 
	- Simple stuff, like hook up speakers to it and use it as a music player... or
	- Build your own Hardware! You can connect buttons, lights, a small screen, etc!

Here's what's in the box:

| What is it?                 | What's it for?? |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| 1x Raspberry Pi 2 (Model B) | A single-board 1Ghz quad-core computer with 1GB Ram! |
| Case and Power Supply       | Put the Pi in it, and power it up! |
| 16GB MicroSD Card           | This is the "hard drive" for your Pi! We'll put Linux on this. |
| SILabs USB to UART Bridge   | We can use this to connect to the Pi from our normal computer, when we don't have a screen or a ethernet cable for the Pi. |



### What the hell Niels, what kind of Christmas gift is this? Now what?

It was Pierre-Henri's idea! Anyway, the point is:


Here's some ideas!


### OK I guess that's cool... What might I build with this?
