# The Joubert Family's Christmas Coding Adventure!

The Joubert family all gets Raspberry Pi computers for Christmas, and embarks on a *Coding Adventure!*

## What the hell Niels, what kind of Christmas gift is this crap? Now what??

It was Pierre-Henri's idea! Anyway, the point is:

1. This gift is a **real computer**. It can do everything your laptop can do. 
2. You can actually build real stuff with it!
